I thought I'd go back and create a little streamlit demo of the project to showcase the functionality. Upon review, I can't figure out a way to apply the functionality of the app I built. There is code in there that out performed the state of the art in spell checking but no way to actually use it. 
So, one lesson is clear. Losing sight of the use case and the user experience of an app will doom it to failure.
I need to refocus my work with Allies on the user experience. 
And my response is clear as well. I have to fix this in order to learn from it. So Iâ€™ll start again from project definition.
